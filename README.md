# Sftp Performance

The hardware used for generating the data in these benchmarks was

    windows 10 - 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB memory.

**WindTerm 1.2, FileZilla 3.48.1, WinSCP 5.17.2 (Build 10278)** tests are performed on WSL(Ubuntu 18.04.2). 

**All test data is for reference only.**

- 5GB huge file (5,154,830 KB), generated by random data

| | Download Time | Download Rate | Upload Time | Upload Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WindTerm (Use high speed transfer) | **22s** | **234.3 MB/s** | **21s** | **245.5 MB/s** |
| WindTerm | 37s | 139.3 MB/s | 43s | 119.9 MB/s |
| FileZilla | 32s | 161.1 MB/s | 30s | 171.8 MB/s |
| WinSCP | 81s | 63.7 MB/s | 91s | 56.7 MB/s |

- 4400 files, 16 folders (107,042 KB), unzipped from [vim-7.4.1049.zip](https://github.com/vim/vim/archive/v7.4.1049.zip)

# Terminal Performance

The hardware used for generating the data in these benchmarks was

    windows 10 - 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB memory.
    MacOs 10.13 - 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 and 8GB memory.

**WindTerm, rxvt, putty, xterm** tests are performed on WSL(Ubuntu 18.04.2). 

**Iterm2, kitty, Alacritty** tests are performed on MacOS shell, 

    For WindTerm: No color scheme used in windterm. Color scheme will result in approximately 2% loss and more memory usage.

    For Alacritty: Can not find how to set the scrollback lines limit, so every test use its default setting and no memory usage measured.

The version of terminals:

    windterm      v0.8
    rxvt-unicode: v9.2.2
    putty:        v0.71
    xterm:        v3.30
    iterm2:       v3.3.6
    alacritty:    v0.3.3
    kitty:        v0.14.6

**All test data is for reference only.**

- 97.6MB random text (102,401,504 bytes, 1,329,878 lines, generated and tested by [random_test.sh](https://github.com/kingToolbox/WindTerm/blob/master/benchmark/urandom_test.sh))

In all cases, three runs were made to warm system caches. The reported numbers are the median of five runs. 

1. Telnet:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WindTerm | unlimited | **51.6** | **98.5** |
| rxvt | 1,350,000 | 37.8 | 842.2 |

| xterm | 1,350,000 | 2.2 | 3328.4 |

2. SSH:

| Putty | 1,350,000 | 4.8 | 734.9 |
| xterm | 1,350,000 | 2.3 | 3328.4 |

3. Shell:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iterm2 | unlimited | - (Take too long time) | more than 1300 |
| kitty | unlimited | 17.2 | 2655 |
